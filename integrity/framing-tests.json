  "description": "Framing Invariance Test Suite for the Constitutional Fidelity Index",
  "version": "1.0",
  "methodology": "Each government action is presented in three distinct framings: favorable (emphasizing benefits/intentions), unfavorable (emphasizing risks/criticisms), and neutral (factual description). The CFI's core constitutional scores should not vary significantly across framings. Score variation exceeding the threshold indicates the index is sensitive to framing rather than substantive constitutional analysis, revealing bias vectors. A robust constitutional assessment should yield consistent dimension scores regardless of rhetorical framing.",
